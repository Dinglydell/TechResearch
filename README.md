# TechResearch

An expiremental (very WIP) mod designed to a research system to the game. Some recipes must be researched before being useable.

The idea was basically "if magic mods can have research (thaumcraft), then why not make tech mods have research".

Recipes can be freely added/removed through config files, however to restrict other methods of crafting (like recipes for another mod's machine) an addon is required to make that work.

The mod is designed to be flexible such that an addon can easily change the tech tree, the types of research points that exist and how they're obtained.

At the start, the player only knows that "research points" exist and can make observations (such as observing falling) to obtain them.
By advancing through the tech tree, the player will discover that actually research can be broken down into 2 categories: science and engineering. The points obtained through experiments automatically become more specialised as more specialised points are discovered. Some more advanced techs will require more specialised points to research.

Specialised points can always be spent as if they were their parent type.

At any time, the mod gives the player 3 options for research which are randomly selected from valid options.

Eventually, I plan to add dedicated experiments that can be constructed to obtain research, obviously including particle accellerators. However currently there's just a crappy "pendulum" block that doesn't even have a texture yet.
